################################################

The Financial Portfolio Tracking System (FPTS) is a JavaFX application.  

Below is how to install and run FPTS:

Java 8.1+: http://java.com/en/download/
(This comes with JavaFX.  For JavaFX development, read this: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/preparing-for-javafx-application-development.html)

A folder in the same location as the FPTS.jar on your machine named "data" without quotes.
This is where you can put the csv files (equities.csv, portfolio.csv, etc.)

If you would like to use the start.bat file as well for debugging purposes, put it in 
this directory and run it.

Functionality: Transactions may be buggy as they were the last to be implemented without thorough testing.
Otherwise, everything should run, although form validation may not display helpful errors like "field cannot be blank"
on some forms like the "Add Holdings" window.
